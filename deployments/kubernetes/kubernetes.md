Overview : 

        - What ? 
                . Kubernetes is a tool for running bunch of different Containers together
                . We will give some configuration files to describe how we want our containers to run and interact with each other
                . It basically runs some different programs and make communication between those progs very easy and string forward

            Nodes   - All these single virtual machine referred to as a Nodes
            Master  - Programme to manage everything inside cluster

                  specifically, the service 1 running on it. And we'd have to figure out how to do the same thing to have it reach out to this first virtual machine and the service running on there as well.

                . To create a Container from an image we need a configuration configFile, here we will tell Kubernetes how to manage our 
                  Pods/Containers and Communication.
                . Now we need to pass this file to Kubernetes using Kubectl(command line tool)
                . Kubernetes cluster is going to read this file
                . Now it will try to find out the copy of Service Image. First it will look into the computer only(docker damon) an dif it 
                  is not available it is going to get it from the Docker Hub
                . Once it finds the Image it is going to create a 2 Container
                . Each Container that is created is going to be hosted or created something called Pods
                . Kubernetes is also going to create deployment
                . Deployment is going to read from the configFile and maintain/managing the copies 
                . If something goes wrong with the Pods/Containers (if it crashes) then deployment will make sure to that Pods automatically 
                  gets recreated 
                . Deployments makes sure that we have right number of Pods and is running 
                . We also has Service
