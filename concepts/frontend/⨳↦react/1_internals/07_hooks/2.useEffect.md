        This hook is to handle the things on re-render
    ```js
            - useEffect(()=>{
                console.log("re-renders")       -> // this is going to get called on each re-render ;
               })  

            - useEffect(()=>{
                console.log("re-renders")       -> // this is going to get called when dependency changes ;
               },[dependency])  
            // This is going to do a shallow comparison (only when the dependency array contains primitive values )
            // In case of object passed as dependency it is going to object is going to change on every single re-render

            - useEffect(()=>{
                console.log("re-renders")       -> // this is going to get called only when component mounts ;
               },[])  
            
            - useEffect(()=>{
                return ()=> {
                    console.log("un-mount")     -> // this is going to get called on cleanups(for dependency) and on component 
                    }                              // unmounting for empty array;
               },[])  
    ```
