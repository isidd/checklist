Overview :
In MPA we get multiple pages where each page has the content for a given route
Browser will reach out to the server then server will give alle resources req like html css Javascript.
Every new page we fetch is downloaded
Here each of the page is normal HTML css code and pages don't know about each other
We call Render call too often to render our diff component in different routes

Pros :

- SCO is simple | crawler sees what the user sees

- Slower, constantly needs to load pages | if the server is slow the application is slow
- Tightly coupled frontend and backend

Tend to support more legacy browser
