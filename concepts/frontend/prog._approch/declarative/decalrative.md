Overview :

    Declarative Programming :
        It is a style of programming in which you describe what you want the programme to accomplish without describing HOW.
        eg:
        How to eat a fruit
        there is programme/function called -> eatAFruit | where we may pass no of slices but | we will not describe the
        steps describing HOW.
      - It is taking away steps and providing an abstraction above the Imperative Programming

      - Declarative Systems is always built on top Imperative Programming
