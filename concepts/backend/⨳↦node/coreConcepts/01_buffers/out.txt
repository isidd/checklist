                                            Buffers
        Buffer is a container in memory that temporally holds fixed length sequence of bytes
                                            (buffer)
                                        |---------------|
                                   ---> | 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 | --->
                                   ---> | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | --->
                                        |---------------|
                                     It holds raw binary data

            . Javascript does't have a way to deal with raw binary data
            . But in Node we have buffers so it can deal with raw binary data (files, streams..)
