/*
1. Prototypical Inheritance vs class based inheritance

    Class based inheritance is a classical way of inheritance 
    where as in Protypal inheritance we have a proto object attached to the reffering object 
    and all the inherited class will also point to that proto object of the parent class 
    using a method called prototpe chaining
